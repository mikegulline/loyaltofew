          Loyal To Few速 is a family-owned business started by a retired
          firefighter/paramedic. What began as a mindset for survival, turned
          into a tattoo, and eventually evolved into a one-of-a-kind clothing
          brand that men and women of all ages who have overcome adversity can
          relate to.

          Sometimes in life you realize you have let people in who don&apos;t
          want the best for you, who take and never give. Surrounding yourself
          with family and a small circle of friends who will remain in your
          corner no matter how difficult the circumstances has become our
          trademarked way of life. Trim the fat, divorce the bullshit, and
          don&apos;t waste time or energy on people who hinder your personal
          growth and success.

          A life without hardships is inevitable, but you can meet any challenge
          if you surround yourself with people who have your best interests in
          mind and will never turn their backs on you. When the dust settles and
          you see the ones still standing by your side, you have found your
          Loyal to Few速.
