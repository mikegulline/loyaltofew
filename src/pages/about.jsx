        <P>
          Loyal To Few速 is a family-owned business started by a retired
          firefighter/paramedic and his older, much smarter brother. What began
          as a mindset for survival, turned into a tattoo, and eventually
          evolved into a one-of-a-kind clothing brand that men and women of all
          ages who have overcome adversity can relate to.

          Sometimes in life, we realize that we have let people in who
          don&apos;t want the best for you, who take and never give. Surrounding
          ourselves with family and a small circle of friends who will remain in
          our corner no matter how difficult the circumstances has become our
          trademarked way of life. We trim the fat, divorce the bullshit, and
          don&apos;t waste time or energy on people who hinder our personal
          growth and success.

          A life with hardships is inevitable, but you can meet any challenge if
          you surround yourself with people who have your best interests in mind
          and will never turn their backs on you. When the dust settles and you
          see the ones still standing by our side, you have found your Loyal to
          Few速.
