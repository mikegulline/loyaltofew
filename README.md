## About

Loyal To Few速 is a family-owned business started by a retired firefighter/paramedic and his older, much smarter brother. What began as a mindset for survival, turned into a tattoo, and eventually evolved into a one-of-a-kind clothing brand that men and women of all ages who have overcome adversity can relate to.

Sometimes in life, we realize that we have let people in who don't want the best for you, who take and never give. Surrounding ourselves with family and a small circle of friends who will remain in our corner no matter how difficult the circumstances has become our trademarked way of life. We trim the fat, divorce the bullshit, and don't waste time or energy on people who hinder our personal growth and success.

A life with hardships is inevitable, but you can meet any challenge if you surround yourself with people who have your best interests in mind and will never turn their backs on you. When the dust settles and you see the ones still standing by our side, you have found your Loyal to Few速.
