        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Loyal To Few is a family-owned business started in 2020 by a retired
          firefighter/paramedic. What began as a simple mindset, turned into a
          tattoo, and eventually evolved into a one-of-a-kind clothing brand
          that men and women of all ages and backgrounds can relate to.
        </p>

        <p>
          We acquired the domain name, built a website, secured an official
          Trademark, and got to work building our 100% American-made brand in
          our home state of California.
        </p>

        <p>
          People often come into your life and despite what they may say,
          don&lsquo;t really want the best for you. Surrounding yourself with
          family and a small circle of friends that will remain in your corner
          no matter how difficult the circumstances, has become our trademarked
          way of life. Trim the fat, divorce the bullshit and don&lsquo;t waste
          time or energy on people that hinder your personal growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life will always find a way to throw its share of negative situations
          your way, but you must figure out a way through them. When the dust
          settles and you see the ones still standing by your side, you have
          found your Loyal to Few.
